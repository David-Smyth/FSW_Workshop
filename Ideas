Few ideas imported from Internet or any non-FSW culture.

For example, still making things up, like CCSDS SOIS Electronic Data 
Sheets, instead of leveraging open standards like JSON.

Nobody wants to use anyone else's software.

All code takes training to learn how to use technology in a project.

Maybe its time to invert the model -- just use open source, never develop 
nor fly non-open source. Then, its not a matter of getting ITAR issues 
cleared before making open source. Instead, start open source and then 
there are no ITAR issues.

Scratch? What is that? A language? A test environment?

What is a good strategy to leverage open source for major advantage?

LARS sure can provide Millennium Space value!

JPL going down path of using Rhapsody and SysML for their MBE approach. 
Kinda blows compared to Simulink.
